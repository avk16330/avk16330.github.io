    <p>My name is Alex Konieczny and I am a Communication Studies major at the University of Georgia. I spent two and a half years at the University of Alabama where I fell in love with some Crimson Tide football. I have always been a dawg at heart though. I love spending time with my family and friends especially getting to travel with them! Two of my favorite things in this world are college football and traveling. I have been blessed to be able to travel to several places so far and love to share pictures of my trips!</p>
